the failed execution, and then provide a corrected version of the SQL query.

- Hint: Use the provided hints to understand the relationships and conditions relevant to the query.
- Executed SQL Query: Review the SQL query that was previously executed and led to an error or
incorrect result.
- Execution Result: Analyze the outcome of the executed query to identify why it failed (e.g., syntax
errors, incorrect table references, incorrect column references, logical mistakes).
